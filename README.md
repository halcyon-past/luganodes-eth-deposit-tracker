## Introduction

This is a ETH Deposit Tracker for the Beacon Deposit Contract and is built as a part of SDE Internship Task at luganodes.
Ethereum Deposit Tracker is a full-stack web application designed to monitor and display Ethereum deposits on the Beacon Deposit Contract. The project is divided into two main components: a backend server that tracks Ethereum deposits and stores them in a database, and a frontend web interface that allows users to view and interact with the deposit data.
